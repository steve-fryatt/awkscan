<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>AwkScan</cite> is an application to search the <cite>Archive</cite> ArcScan magazine and disc index files.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Installing AwkScan" file="Installation">

<cite>AwkScan</cite> can be used on the <cite>Archive</cite> CD without any further installation. However, if your system uses RISC OS 3.6 or earlier, you may have to install the <cite>CallASWI</cite> module before searching will work. If you get an error asking for the module when <cite>AwkScan</cite> is run, you will need to <link ref="CallASWI">install CallASWI</link> as described below. It also requires the 32-bit Shared C Library to be present; this can be downloaded from <link ref="#url http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/system.shtml">http://www.iyonix.com/32bit/system.shtml</link> with full installation instructions.

If you wish to copy <cite>AwkScan</cite> to your hard disc or have obtained your copy from somewhere else, you will also need the ArcScan index files.  Copy the <file>!AwkScan</file> application to a suitable location (you may want to create a new directory called something like <file>AwkScan</file> for it to live in).  From the <file>ArcScan</file> directory of the <cite>Archive</cite> CD, copy the <file>archive</file> and <file>ardiscs</file> directories with their contents into the new directory with <file>!AwkScan</file>.  The installation is now complete and you can start the <cite>AwkScan</cite> application.

It is also possible to make <cite>AwkScan</cite> read the indexes from another location (this is not necessary to run <cite>AwkScan</cite>).  To do this, <key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!AwkScan</file> and load the <file>!Run</file> file into a text editor.  Find the lines that read

<codeblock>
| These paths point to the magazine and disc data:
| change the paths as appropriate.

Set AwkScan$Mag &lt;AwkScan$Dir&gt;.^.Archive
Set AwkScan$Discs &lt;AwkScan$Dir&gt;.^.ArDiscs
</codeblock>

and change the paths to the location of the relevant directories.

Note that, on old versions of RISC OS with 256 character restrictions on system variables, <cite>AwkScan</cite> can have problems running from a directory with a long pathname.  The only solution (apart from upgrading to RISC OS 4) is to move it higher up the directory tree.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing CallASWI" file="CallASWI">

On systems running RISC OS 3.6 and earlier, <cite>AwkScan</cite> needs the <cite>CallASWI</cite> module to be present before it can be run. This is likely to be present already, as a lot of StrongARM compatible applications require the module, but if running <cite>AwkScan</cite> produces an error asking for <cite>CallASWI</cite>, it will need to be installed.

The module is supplied in the directory with <file>!AwkScan</file>, in the <file>CallASWI</file> directory. To install it, proceed as follows:

<list type="num" spacing=1>
<li>Find your System directory.  On systems with the new <cite>!Boot</cite> application in the root directory of the hard disc, <key>shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Boot</file> and open the <file>Resources</file> directory inside.  The  <file>!System</file> directory should be in here. On machines without the new <cite>!Boot</cite>, <file>!System</file> may be in the root directory of the hard disc.

If you can not find it, press <key>f12</key> and enter <code>Filer_OpenDir &lt;System$Dir&gt;.^</code>.  Press <key>return</key> twice to get back to the Desktop, and a directory containing <file>!System</file> should be open.

<li>Open <file>!System</file> with a <key>shift</key>-double-click on it.

<li>If <file>!System</file> contains a directory named <file>310</file>, open that and then open the directory inside it named <file>Modules</file>.  If there is no <file>310</file> directory, open the directory in <file>!System</file> called <file>Modules</file>.

<li>Copy the <cite>CallASWI</cite> module into the <file>Modules</file> directory that has been opened.
</list>

<cite>CallASWI</cite> is now installed on your system and <cite>AwkScan</cite> should be able to be run.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using AwkScan" file="Using">

Double click on <cite>!AwkScan</cite> to install it on the iconbar.

Click on the <cite>AwkScan</cite> icon bar icon to open the search window.  Enter a word or phrase to search for into the top field and click on <icon>Search</icon>.  The <cite>ArcScan</cite> indexes will be searched and a scrolling window will open showing any matches that are found.

A second word or phrase can be entered into the lower field.  Between the two is a pop-up menu which controls how the two pieces of text are used.  <menu>And</menu> requires <em>both</em> words or phrases to be found, <menu>Or</menu> is satisfied if <em>either</em> is found.

The standard <code>*</code> and <code>#</code> wildcards can be used to stand for any zero or more characters and <em>one</em> character respectively.  For example, <code>Arch#ve</code> would match <code>Archive</code> or <code>Archave</code> but not <code>Archve</code> or <code>Architrave</code>.  However, <code>Arch*ve</code> would match all of the examples given, but not <code>Archived</code>. The use of wildcards can be affected by the settings in the <link ref="Choices">choices window</link>.

The <icon>Case sensitive</icon> switch tells <cite>AwkScan</cite> whether or not to take the case of letters into account when matching the pieces of text.

The search window can be opened by clicking either <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse> on the icon bar icon.  By default, unless it is changed in the <link ref="Choices">choices window</link>, opening the window with <mouse>select</mouse> will leave the previous search set up while using <mouse>adjust</mouse> will cause all the fields to be cleared.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Choices" file="Choices">

Selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from the icon bar menu allows the way that <cite>AwkScan</cite> works to be changed.

<icon>Simple wildcards</icon> controls the use of the <code>*</code> and <code>#</code> wildcards as described above.  If it is on, these work as described; if not, the wild cards are replaced by the more powerful (and complex) <link ref="RegExps">regular expressions</link> as described below.

<icon>Select opens blank search</icon> determines the way in which <mouse>select</mouse> or <mouse>adjust</mouse> work on the icon bar icon.  Toggling this option on and off reverses the actions of the two mouse buttons.

The <icon>Child task memory</icon> setting controls how much memory is used for searching the index.  The 640Kb default should not need changing, although it can be increased if necessary.

</chapter>




<chapter title="The Database" file="Database">

The <cite>ArcScan</cite> indexes used by <cite>AwkScan</cite> can be accessed from the <menu>Database</menu> submenu of the icon bar menu.  To open the directories containing the indexes that <cite>AwkScan</cite> is using, choose <menu>Database-&gt;Open</menu>.  If you update the indexes by dragging in new files (from the Archive CD, say), you should then choose <menu>Database-&gt;Update</menu> to warn <cite>AwkScan</cite> that the database has been updated.

</chapter>



<chapter title="Search files" file="Files">

The database can also be searched using "search files".  These are text files that are dragged to the <cite>AwkScan</cite> icon.  The files describe what you are looking for and the results are displayed in a window as before. Search files are an <em>alternative</em> to the <link ref="Using">search window</link>: using them is not a requirement!  In fact, <cite>AwkScan</cite> will generate a search file for itself to use each time you start a search from the <window>search window</window>, although the user will never normally see this.

Blank lines in search files are ignored by <cite>AwkScan</cite>. A line of the form

<codeblock>
# case
</codeblock>

will tell <cite>AwkScan</cite> to distinguish upper and lower case for the purposes of searching. The default is no case distinction. Any other line starting with <code>#</code> will be ignored. As for lines not starting with <code>#</code>, <cite>AwkScan</cite> will produce those records in the database that match at least one of them. So for example

<codeblock>
# Any supermarkets mentioned?
Safeways
Tesco
Asda
Waitrose
</codeblock>

should be self-explanatory. This could also be written on one line as

<codeblock>
Safeways|Tesco|Asda|Waitrose
</codeblock>

To search for a record mentioning both Safeways and Tesco, use

<codeblock>
# Both mentioned
Safeways &amp;&amp; Tesco
</codeblock>

In fact, the non-comment nonblank lines in a search file should be a sequence of standard <link ref="RegExps">regular expressions</link>, separated by the conjunction symbol <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.  Blank spaces to either side of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>s are discounted. To search for two consecutive ampersands use

<codeblock>
(&amp;)(&amp;)
</codeblock>

to avoid confusion with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Regular Expressions" file="RegExps">

In search files, the characters <code>\</code> <code>^</code> <code>$</code> <code>.</code> <code>[</code> <code>]</code> <code>|</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code> <code>*</code> <code>+</code> and <code>?</code> are known as <cite>metacharacters</cite> because they play a special role in describing regular expressions.

A basic regular expression is one of:

<definition target="A non-metacharacter">
This matches itself.
</definition>

<definition target="An escape sequence">
An escape sequence is any one of the following series of characters:

<list>
<li><code>\b</code> - backspace
<li><code>\f</code> - formfeed
<li><code>\n</code> - newline
<li><code>\r</code> - carriage return
<li><code>\t</code> - tab
<li><code>\c</code> - <code>c</code> any other, non-digit character - matches <code>c</code>.
<li><code>\ddd</code> - <code>ddd</code> octal value giving ASCII code
</list>

Escape sequences have to be used to denote metacharacters literally.
</definition>

<definition target="^">
<code>^</code> matches beginning of a record.
</definition>

<definition target="$">
<code>$</code> matches end of a record.
</definition>

<definition target=".">
<code>.</code> matches any single character.
</definition>

<definition target="A character class">
<code>[AZQ]</code> matches <code>A</code> or <code>Z</code> or <code>Q</code>. <code>[A-Z]</code> matches any upper case letter. <code>[^0-9]</code> represents any non-digit character.
</definition>

Regular expressions can be combined.  For example:

<list>
<li><code>A|B</code> matches either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>.
<li><code>AB</code> matches an <code>A</code> followed by a <code>B</code>.
<li><code>A*</code> matches zero or more <code>A</code>'s.
<li><code>A+</code> matches one or more <code>A</code>'s.
<li><code>A?</code> the empty string or an <code>A</code>.
<li><code>(A)</code> matches the strings that match <code>A</code>.
</list>

Since items in a record in the Archive database are separated by carriage returns

<codeblock>
\r![LU]
</codeblock>

would produce all records having an item starting with <code>!L</code> or <code>!U</code>. To find a record with an item ending <code>ok?</code> use the pattern

<codeblock>
ok\?\r
</codeblock>

To match all records for, say, Issue 11, use the pattern <code>\r\\11.</code> The pattern <code>\r\\11[ ]40</code> will match those records occurring in Issue 11 on page 40.
