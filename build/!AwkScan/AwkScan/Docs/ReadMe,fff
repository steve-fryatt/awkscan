AwkScan v.0.1 was contrapted by G.C.Wraith on 4/3/2
at the request of Paul Beverley.
It uses Michael Brennan's mawk 1.3.3, ported to
Risc OS by G.C.Wraith on 24/1/0. Mawk is covered
by conditions of the GNU Public Licence (see the
file COPYING). Its Risc OS sources can be downloaded
from http://awk.riscos.org.uk/.

The AwkScan icon is supposed to depict an auk
carring a magnifying glass under its left wing;
sorry about that.
